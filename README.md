## 📦 Installation and Configuration

Please refer to [setup.md](/doc/setup_en.md) for installation and configuration steps.

## 🔁 Process Overview

The basic workflow for using reinforcement learning to achieve motion control is:

`Train` → `Play` → `Sim2Sim` → `Sim2Real`

- **Train**: Use the Gym simulation environment to let the robot interact with the environment and find a policy that maximizes the designed rewards. Real-time visualization during training is not recommended to avoid reduced efficiency.
- **Play**: Use the Play command to verify the trained policy and ensure it meets expectations.
- **Sim2Sim**: Deploy the Gym-trained policy to other simulators to ensure it’s not overly specific to Gym characteristics.
- **Sim2Real**: Deploy the policy to a physical robot to achieve motion control.

## 🛠️ User Guide

### 1. Training

Run the following command to start training:

```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=xxx
```

#### ⚙️ Parameter Description
- `--task`: Required parameter; values can be (go2, g1, h1, h1_2).
- `--headless`: Defaults to starting with a graphical interface; set to true for headless mode (higher efficiency).
- `--resume`: Resume training from a checkpoint in the logs.
- `--experiment_name`: Name of the experiment to run/load.
- `--run_name`: Name of the run to execute/load.
- `--load_run`: Name of the run to load; defaults to the latest run.
- `--checkpoint`: Checkpoint number to load; defaults to the latest file.
- `--num_envs`: Number of environments for parallel training.
- `--seed`: Random seed.
- `--max_iterations`: Maximum number of training iterations.
- `--sim_device`: Simulation computation device; specify CPU as `--sim_device=cpu`.
- `--rl_device`: Reinforcement learning computation device; specify CPU as `--rl_device=cpu`.

**Default Training Result Directory**: `logs/<experiment_name>/<date_time>_<run_name>/model_<iteration>.pt`

---

### 2. Play

To visualize the training results in Gym, run the following command:

```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task=xxx
```

**Description**:

- Play’s parameters are the same as Train’s.
- By default, it loads the latest model from the experiment folder’s last run.
- You can specify other models using `load_run` and `checkpoint`.

#### 💾 Export Network

Play exports the Actor network, saving it in `logs/{experiment_name}/exported/policies`:
- Standard networks (MLP) are exported as `policy_1.pt`.
- RNN networks are exported as `policy_lstm_1.pt`.

### 3. Sim2Sim (Mujoco)

Run Sim2Sim in the Mujoco simulator:

```bash
python deploy/deploy_mujoco/deploy_mujoco.py {config_name}
```

#### Parameter Description
- `config_name`: Configuration file; default search path is `deploy/deploy_mujoco/configs/`.

#### Example: Running G1

```bash
python deploy/deploy_mujoco/deploy_mujoco.py g1.yaml
```

#### ➡️ Replace Network Model

The default model is located at `deploy/pre_train/{robot}/motion.pt`; custom-trained models are saved in `logs/g1/exported/policies/policy_lstm_1.pt`. Update the `policy_path` in the YAML configuration file accordingly.

### 4. Sim2Real (Physical Deployment)

Before deploying to the physical robot, ensure it’s in debug mode. Detailed steps can be found in the [Physical Deployment Guide](deploy/deploy_real/README.md):

```bash
python deploy/deploy_real/deploy_real.py {net_interface} {config_name}
```


#### Parameter Description
- `net_interface`: Network card name connected to the robot, e.g., `enp3s0`.
- `config_name`: Configuration file located in `deploy/deploy_real/configs/`, e.g., `g1.yaml`, `h1.yaml`, `h1_2.yaml`.

#### Deployment Results

#### Deploy with C++
There is also an example of deploying the G1 pre-trained model in C++. the C++ code is located in the following directory.

```
deploy/deploy_real/cpp_g1
```

First, navigate to the directory above.

```base
cd deploy/deploy_real/cpp_g1
```

The C++ implementation depends on the LibTorch library, download the LibTorch

```bash
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.1%2Bcpu.zip
unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.1+cpu.zip
```

To build the project, executable the following steps

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

After successful compilation, executate the program with:

```base
./g1_deploy_run {net_interface}
```

Replace `{net_interface}` with your actual network interface name (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
